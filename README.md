# CO2_emissions

This is the seventh and final completed assignment (i.e., Module 7) of the Winc Academy Course "Data Analytics with Python".

The assignment has been completed within two separate Jupyter Notebooks, the first to answer Questions 1 and 2 of the assignment, the second to answer Question 3 of the assignment.

Results of this data analysis, with my answers to each of Q1, Q2, and Q3, are summarized in a PDF report, which also contains the most relevant charts and table from the Jupyter Notebooks.  Results are interpreted and discussed, with final conclusions to answer each question of the assignment.

In addition, all datasets used for the assignment (relevant CSV files from www.ourworldindata.org) can be found in the folder "datasets", and image files (both PNG and JPEG) off all charts and the table in the report can be found in the folder "charts".  Please feel free to share these, however, please provide proper credit to this Github folder and report when you do so.
